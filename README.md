### Quotum - Categorical Quote Database ###

The purpose of Quotum is to allow users to store strings of texts as
quotations. Typically this would include conversations or things people have
said. In addition, the platform allows quotes to be categorised so that quotes
pertaining to particular topics can be searched.

Quotum is written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) and uses
[Snap](http://snapframework.com/) as its web framework and
[acid-state](http://acid-state.seize.it/) as its database backend. Pages and
stylesheets are written using [Heist](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/heist)
and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) respectively. Quotum is available under the
MIT license.
